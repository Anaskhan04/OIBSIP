This repository contains the projects and tasks I completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. Throughout the program, I worked on improving my web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Not knowing how to approach some challenges initially, I incorporated tools like ChatGPT to guide my learning and successfully created responsive and interactive web projects. This experience helped me tackle real-world coding problems and enhanced my ability to build engaging web applications.
